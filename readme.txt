A suite of word counters, keyword counters and readability analysis for your blog.

== Description ==

Word Stats adds a suite of linguistic diagnostics to help you keep track of your content and improve its quality.

The reports page lets you select an author and period to analyze, and displays:

* The total word count.
* The number and percentage of posts of each post type.
* The top 20 keywords.
* The percentage of posts of basic, intermediate and advanced readability level.
* A graph with monthly word counts for each post type.
* Diagnostics tables, with links to edit the posts that may be too short, too long, too difficult, too simple, lack relevant keywords or abuse certain keywords.

You can display the total word counts for each post type in your dashboard, widget areas and inside your posts with the &#91;wordcounts&#93; shortcode.

Word Stats also extends the info area of the post edit form with these live stats:

* Relevant keywords. Common words can be blacklisted with regular expressions in the settings page.
* A more accurate word count.
* Color coded readability tests: Automated Readability Index, Coleman-Liau Index and LIX.
* Total characters, alphanumeric characters, words and sentences.
* Characters per word, characters per sentence, words per sentence.

Additionally, an extra column with the readability level of each post can be displayed in the manage posts list.

Word Stats includes basic support for Unicode scripts, including cyrillic, greek, arabic, hindi and japanese (mileage may vary).

Spanish and Catalan translations are bundled with the plugin.

== Upgrade Notice ==
= 4.3 =
Although no new features are included, this is a substantial code rewrite. Test it before using it in a production enviroment!

If you have been having problems with stats caching getting stuck, this release may help. Caching is now done via WP-Cron instead of an AJAX call. Also caching of unpublished posts is deferred until the option to count them is selected. The changes also cover the possible source of some reported problems with stats not updating correctly.

== Installation ==

1. Install it from the plugins admin page, or upload the zip with WordPress' built-in tool, or unzip it to 'wp-content/plugins'.
2. Activate it.
3. Go to Settings | Word Stats and set up the optional features.

**Uninstall note**

* All settings and post metadata, save the premium status, are deleted when you uninstall the plugin.
* If you want to retain the settings and/or metadata, disable the plugin instead of uninstalling it, or delete it manually from the plugins folder.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**The stats caching notice seems stuck**

* If your version is older than 4.3, try upgrading.
* Sometimes WP Cron doesn't start a scheduled work right away. Wait a minute and load any page.
* Check that WP Cron isn't disabled.

**The word count/readability calculation isn't accurate**

Word Stats uses simple algorithms (but more elaborate than the PHP word counter). For fairly ordinary English texts they will closely match human counting. The margin of error will be greater for short pieces, text with complex punctuation or in other languages, but they should be still good indicators.

**Some HTML/shortcode words are being counted as keywords**

Some cases are still not filtered out. Report them in the plugin support forum or via email.

**This plugin makes my site slow**

Some of the plugin's tasks can be a bit intensive, specially on large blogs. Try disabling counting for unpublished posts, and live stats when you don't need them. Our resources are limited, for now we are working on features rather than optimization.

**Some common words show as keywords, even though the setting to exclude common words is activated**

The built in lists only exclude some of the most common words. Performing many matches with regular expressions can be very slow.

**Why the live counters seem to lag?**

The calculations are refreshed every few seconds.

**Are the ignored keywords counted in the total words?**

Yes. They are ignored only for keyword counts.

**Do the indexes really reflect how easy is the text?**

They try to reflect how easy the text is to read. You can write an article about relativity in simple English and it will be rated as low level.

**What do the readability number mean?**

For ARI and CLI, they are the U.S. grade level of the text. Roughly, grade level 1 corresponds to ages 6-8, grade 8 to 14 years old, grade 12 to 17 years old.

For LIX:

* below 25: Children's Books
* 25 - 30: Simple texts
* 30 - 40: Normal Text / Fiction
* 40 - 50: Factual information, such as Wikipedia
* 50 - 60: Technical texts
* over 60: Specialist texts / research / dissertations

Each index uses a different algorithm:

* ARI is based on word length and words per sentence.
* CLI is based on characters per 100 words, excluding non-word characters, and sentences per 100 words
* LIX is based on average words between pauses (periods, colons, semicolons, etc.) and average words longer than 6 characters.

Check [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test) for more information.

**Why other common tests aren't included?**

These three indexes don't rely on syllable counting, which is a bit more complicated and language dependent.

**The stats page timed out.**

Try selecting a shorter period, disabling the setting to count drafts and pending posts, disabling the setting to ignore common words or shortening your list of ignored keywords.
